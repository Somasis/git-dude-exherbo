# git-dude-exherbo

This is a heavily modified version of git-dude which I have no intent of merging with
my main fork of it. I am using this as a git commit bot for #exherbo, to use for the
unofficial repositories.

It isn't really intended for public consumption, but it's GPL and might be of use to
someone else, so here it is.

## Usage
(this is still being written)

1. Get a directory of the repositories you need monitored going
2. Pipe in `ii`; ex. `git-dude | tee -a ~/irc/irc.freenode.net/#exherbo{,-bots}/in`
